This is a database backup script for all Zabbix versions up to 2.4.0.
It distincts between configuration and mass data tables.

Tables holding configuration data will be fully backuped while for mass data tables only the table schema is stored.

This way you have a small backup of your complete configuration, and in case of disaster "only" use your item history.
